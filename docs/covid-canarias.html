<h2 id="the-plot">The Plot</h2>
<p>This plots deaths (all causes) for the Canary Islands over time, with expected deaths for that same time period. The data is from the <a href="https://momo.isciii.es/public/momo/dashboard/momo_dashboard.html#datos">MoMo</a> project, which started from a study of the yearly flu in 2012. MoMo computes the expected deaths for a given date based on a long running rolling average.</p>
<p>It adds a line to show the novel coronavirus as unexpected deaths<sup>[1]</sup>. This data is from the <a href="https://www3.gobiernodecanarias.org/noticias/">government of the Canary Islands</a>.</p>
<p>Three vertical bars have been added to show:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first reported death in China</li>
<li>The first reported case in Spain, which occurred here on La Gomera</li>
<li>The date that strict lockdown<sup>[2]</sup> measures were imposed</li>
</ol>
<p>Data is gathered daily from MoMo and from the Government of the Canary Islands ArcGIS dashboard. The graph is generated using Python with Pandas and Bokeh.</p>
<p>The code for generating this graph can be found <a href="https://github.com/nathanschepers/covid-canaries">here</a>. For details of how it is put together, please consult the <code>README.md</code> files there.</p>
<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<p><sup>[1]</sup> :</p>
<p>This is calculated by summing the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths with the number of expected deaths for each day.</p>
<p><sup>[2]</sup> :</p>
<p>Lockdown in the Canary islands consisted of a number of measures, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>school closures</li>
<li>closures of all public parks, beaches, or other gathering places</li>
<li>closure of all common spaces in apartment buildings (rooftops, courtyards)</li>
<li>cancelling of all public gatherings (concerts, &amp;c.)</li>
<li>closure of all businesses other than supermarket/pharmacy and supporting business</li>
<li>closure of all hotels (all tourists were required to leave the islands)</li>
<li>severe movement restrictions (unable to leave the house without documentation)</li>
<li>a new street-cleaning initiative, with a focus on the spaces around essential businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>This lockdown has been enforced by police, who were given powers to operate from Madrid. In addition, the Spanish military has been present in a supporting role.</p>
<p>Lockdown measures began to ease on April 13, with some additional businesses (ie. home delivery companies) operating.</p>
<p>As of April 24, no retail establishments are open, and people are only allowed to leave their homes for essential purposes. Essential purposes are defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>travel to/from a supermarket or pharmacy</li>
<li>travel to the doctor or bank</li>
<li>dog walking, within a limited radius of home</li>
</ul>
