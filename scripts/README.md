# Scripts

## `canaries-infections-over-time.py`

This creates an html file (`../output/cases-over-time.html`) which is an interactive graph of the confirmed covid 
cases on the island since the first identified case. It uses the data from `../data`.

## `island-populations.py`

This is a simple bar chart of the populations of the canary islands. Initially created as a test. It could be
improved: for example, it could use the same colour palette as `canaries-infections-over-time.py`

## `new-cases-today.py`

This is a simple bar chart of the new cases on the canary islands. The date is hardcoded in the script. It could be
improved: for example, it could use the same colour palette as `canaries-infections-over-time.py`
